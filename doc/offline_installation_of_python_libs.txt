To create a wheel from the libraries listed in a `requirements.txt` file and then deploy it to another machine, you can follow these steps:

### On the Online Machine:

1. **Create Virtual Environment (Optional)**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. **Install Libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Create Wheel Files**:
    ```bash
    pip wheel -r requirements.txt -w wheelhouse
    ```

   This command will download the packages listed in `requirements.txt` and save their wheel files in the `wheelhouse` directory.

4. **Transfer Wheel Files**:
   
   Transfer the `wheelhouse` directory containing the wheel files to the target machine using a USB drive, file transfer, or any other means of file transfer.

### On the Offline Machine:

1. **Transfer Wheel Files**:
   
   Copy the `wheelhouse` directory to the offline machine.

2. **Install Libraries from Wheel Files**:
    ```bash
    pip install --no-index --find-links=wheelhouse -r requirements.txt
    ```

   This command installs the libraries listed in `requirements.txt` using the wheel files found in the `wheelhouse` directory.

By following these steps, you can create wheel files of libraries online on one machine and deploy them to another machine offline via a `requirements.txt` file. This approach is particularly useful when the offline machine doesn't have direct internet access or when you want to ensure consistent library versions across multiple environments.
